# List: Rotate ( ** Interview Question)
# You are given a list of n integers and a non-negative integer k.

# Your task is to write a function called rotate that takes the list of integers and an integer k as input and rotates the list to the right by k steps.

# The function should modify the input list in-place, and you should not return anything.

# Constraints:

# Each element of the input list is an integer.

# The integer k is non-negative.



# Function signature: def rotate(nums, k):

# Example:

# Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 3
# Function call: rotate(nums, k)
# Output: nums = [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]


# Explanation: The list has been rotated to the right by 3 steps:



# [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# [6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# WRITE ROTATE FUNCTION HERE #
def rotate(nums, k):
    # Calculate the effective rotation.
    # The modulo operator (%) is used to handle cases where
    # k is larger than the length of the list. This ensures
    # that the rotation count is within the bounds of the list's length.
    k = k % len(nums)
 
    # nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]
    # This line performs the rotation of the list.
    # Let's break down the slicing operations:
 
    # nums[-k:]:
    # This slice gets the last 'k' elements of the list.
    # In Python, negative indices start counting from the end of the list.
    # So, -k is the k-th element from the end.
    # For example, if k is 2, nums[-2:] gets the last two elements.
 
    # nums[:-k]:
    # This slice gets all elements of the list except the last 'k'.
    # Here, -k as the stop index in slicing means to stop before
    # the k-th element from the end.
    # For example, if k is 2, nums[:-2] gets all elements except the last two.
 
    # nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]:
    # This concatenates the last 'k' elements (nums[-k:])
    # with the first part of the list (nums[:-k]),
    # effectively rotating the list.
 
    # nums[:] = ...
    # Finally, nums[:] = is used to update the list in place.
    # It changes the original list 'nums' to be the rotated version.
    # Without [:], a new list would be created, and the original list
    # would remain unchanged.
    nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]
